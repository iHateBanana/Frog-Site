I started threeish days ago? Ive been working on the navigation bar mostly so yay! I just fixed the footer which is so cool. Now I just have to figure out how to make the cart and remove the purple underline on my frog names, descriptions, prices, and "add to cart" button :'>  -->

<!-- figured out i forgoot to close the logo img so fixing that solved 25% of my problems  -->


<!-- made most of the site accessible, woot woot!  -->


<!--  I redesigned the "about us" page, and it looks so much better  -->

<!-- started work on the checkout. the only other page that needs work in my opinion is the about us page. i finished the form for the most part, just need to add the frog cards on the right side which should take up a scary amount of time.  -->
